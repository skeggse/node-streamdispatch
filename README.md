node-streamdispatch
===================

A duplex stream dispatcher which preserves order when processing streamed tasks.

Install
=======

```sh
$ npm install streamdispatch
```

Test
====

Any of the following will run the tests.

```sh
$ mocha
$ npm test
$ make test
```

Usage
=====

Pipe data to and from the dispatcher, and it will dispatch each object to a handler, then put the result of the operation back into the stream in-order.

```js
var Dispatch = require('streamdispatch');

var dispatch = new Dispatch();

src.pipe(dispatch).pipe(dest);

dispatch.register(function(data, callback) {
  // transform the data, synchronously or asynchronously. if the operation is
  // guaranteed synchronous, then this module is probably not for you
});
```

This stream is an object stream, meaning that it deals not with Buffers and raw data, but instead of contiguous Objects--these Objects will not mutate as part of the stream, but cannot be sent across a raw stream directly.

Multiple Handlers
-----------------

Dispatch will dispatch data fairly to multiple handlers, using a round-robin queue.

If you find a use for this, let me know...it won't slow you down to have this feature, though.

```js
var Dispatch = require('streamdispatch');

var dispatch = new Dispatch();

src.pipe(dispatch).pipe(dest);

dispatch.register(function(data, callback) {
  // handle the data!
});

dispatch.register(function(data, callback) {
  // handle the data in some other way (will still be from the same stream)
});
```
